    Coming out of the woods

  body: >-
    <p>  <br>It's back in the year and for us too at Studio.DPI, I should tell myself because for now I'm alone behind that name. Several people were already aware of this, following the cessation of my activity in higher education (in any case as a full-time activity), I took two months to reflect on the next project, which follows. I will try to record here the various stages that will mark the birth of this collective. The idea being both to limit me to an exercise of transparency sharing than to document what might eventually inspire other people or create vocations (you are being looked at by the young designers). https://brutalismus3000.bandcamp.com/album/ultrakunst  </p>
